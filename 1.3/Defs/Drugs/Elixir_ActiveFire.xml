The effect can be stacked for up to 48 hours.\n\nThe stength of the effect depends on the quality of the elixir, with the strength increasing by 10% per quality level, or 100% for legendary.\nThe strength will decrease by 5% every time the ingestor recieves damage.\n\nIngesting this elixir will also increase alchemical toxicity by 2.5%, regardless of quality level.</description>
