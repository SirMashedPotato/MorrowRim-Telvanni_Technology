		<description>A genetically engineered plant, created by Great House Telvanni. The grave nut is said to grow best surrounded by corpses. This, of course is pure myth, but it doesn't stop certain Telvanni alchemists. The nut can be crushed, releasing a corrosive liquid commonly referred to as 'grave extract'.</description>

		<description>A genetically engineered plant, created by Great House Telvanni. The leaves of the vampire grass are covered in thousands of minuscule thorns, which cause unnoticeable cuts to anything that walks through it. The thorns can be drained for a heamolysing liquid commonly referred to as 'vampiric extract'.</description>
